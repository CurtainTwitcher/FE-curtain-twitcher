# The Curtain Twitcher <p><small><em>The Glassdoor to your neighbourhood</em></small></p>
The aim of this project is to empower people to be able to visually see the crime and school statistics in a postcodal search area. Whether it is moving to a new neighbourhood or visiting a friend, you can know what sort of area they live in and manage your expectations accordingly.

# Inspiration
- Missing information from Rightmove and Zoopla. Things that aren't transparent and dont give you all the facts about an area. 

- Glassdoor. We wanted to create an app that lifts the curtain from the darker side, and puts a glassdoor for everyone to see through and know whats going on around them.
